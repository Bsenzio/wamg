## A Playable Game of Life on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)

This repository contains the complete source code, assets, and build materials for Bald B: Where Are My Veggies?, a fully playable Nintendo Entertainment System (NES/Famicom) game 
that embeds Conway’s Game of Life as a core gameplay mechanic for artificial life and educational purposes.

The project accompanies the manuscript (*under revision*):

*Vegetables, Enemies, and Emergence: A Playable Game of Life on Nintendo for Educational Purposes*

(submitted to the International Journal of Innovations in Machine Intelligence)

## 📌 Project Overview

*Platform*: *Nintendo Entertainment System / Famicom*

*Genre*: *Educational game, Artificial Life, Retro Game*

**Core Concept**:

A two-phase game in which player actions (vegetable collection under risk) determine the initial conditions of a real-time Game of Life simulation, 
executed under authentic NES hardware constraints.

The project demonstrates that emergent artificial-life behavior can be implemented and meaningfully explored on severely constrained 8-bit hardware, 
using careful algorithmic design, palette-based state encoding, and cycle-accurate programming.

## 🧠 Scientific Contribution

This repository supports reproducibility of the following contributions:

* A cycle-accurate Game of Life kernel implemented in 6502 assembly (CA65)

* A palette-based binary state encoding compatible with NES PPU timing

* A serpentine grid traversal strategy for efficient VRAM updates

* A guided randomness design that exposes players to: emergence, persistence, unpredictability, non-trivial temporal evolution

Integration of an artificial-life system into a fully playable NES game loop

## ▶️ Playing the Game

Online Emulator

A fully playable version of the ROM is available online (no installation required):

The video showcases:
- Phase 1: vegetable collection and enemy interaction  
- Phase 2: Game of Life simulation on NES hardware  
- Real-time palette-based cell updates  
- Serpentine traversal and VBlank-safe execution

## 📦 Physical Media and Printed Materials

![Homebrew](/NESHomebrews.jpg)

This repository also includes all materials required to reproduce the **physical edition**
of the game for educational and archival purposes.

The following items are provided:

- 📘 **Printed Game Manual** (*PDF,print-ready design*)
  Explains Game of Life concepts, artificial life principles, and gameplay mechanics in a
  pedagogical format suitable for children, adolescents, and general audiences.

- 🖼 **Box Art** (*PDF,print-ready design*)  
  Designed following classic NES packaging proportions for educational or exhibition use.

- 🏷 **Cartridge Label Artwork** (*PDF,print-ready design*)
  Ready-to-print label design compatible with standard NES cartridges.

These materials support **diversified pedagogical approaches**, combining:
physical interaction, visual learning, and embodied gameplay with artificial-life concepts.


### 🔁 Reproducibility

This repository is designed to support full reproducibility of the published work:

* All Game of Life logic is implemented in deterministic CA65 assembly

* Timing-critical routines are cycle-counted for NTSC hardware

* No hidden dependencies or proprietary binaries are required

* Given identical inputs and ROM, behavior is deterministic across emulators and real hardware

### 🛠 Build Requirements

To rebuild the ROM from source, you will need:

*  CC65 toolchain (ca65, ld65)

*  NESmaker (for project structure and asset integration)

*  NES Screen Tool (CHR/tile assets)

*  FamiTracker (audio)

*  A standard NES emulator for testing
